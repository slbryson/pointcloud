## Clone this repo

## Installation
Use python pipenv to manage your virtual environments

``` pip install pipenv ```

Then with the given Pipfile in the repo

``` pipenv install ```

Make sure you are always working inside the virtual shell

``` pipenv shell ```

Sync your environment before starting

``` pipenv sync ```
## Run the Notebook
You can use VS Code and run the Jupyter notebook
Make sure you select the correct kernel in the upper right hand corner.
Select the kernel the corresponds with the virtual environment you just installed with pipenv.
This will ensure you have all the pre-requisites for the notebook.

You must create a projects/image directory before starting if it doesn't exist.  COLMAP will expect that structure
Just follow the tutorial / walkthrough after that.
